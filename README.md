# hello-world
Hi, my name is Andrii. I made this hello-world repository just for educational purposes using the <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">guide for beginners</a>. 

Also I am testing the html this time.

The reminder that hello-world repository can be a place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
